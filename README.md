# Network Scanning
Network scanning in cybersecurity is the process of identifying active devices, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities in a network to ensure security and integrity.


# Key aspects of network scanning include:

1. **Device Discovery**: Identifying all devices connected to the network.
2. **Port Scanning**: Checking open ports on devices to understand what services are running.
3. **Service Identification**: Determining the services and applications running on the identified ports.
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detecting known vulnerabilities in the devices, services, and applications.
5. **OS Fingerprinting**: Identifying the operating systems running on network devices.

# Common tools used for network scanning include Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS. Effective network scanning is crucial for proactive network defense, compliance with security standards, and incident response preparation.
